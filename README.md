# TraceMotion

## Overview
TraceMotion is a real-time moving object detection system developed using Python and OpenCV. It processes video frames to detect and highlight moving objects by comparing consecutive frames using frame differencing and contour detection. Ideal for surveillance and smart monitoring applications.

## Features
- Real-time motion detection from live or recorded video
- Frame differencing and contour-based object identification
- Visual highlighting of detected moving objects
- Lightweight and efficient implementation
- Easily extendable for tracking and alerts

## Requirements
- Python 3.13.2
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- imutils
